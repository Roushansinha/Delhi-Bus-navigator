# Delhi-Bus-navigator
This project aims at developing software that allows users to see the information regarding the BUS ROUTE . The project is developed, keeping in mind, the problems of every user have i.e. slow internet connection. To avoid that problem, we have built this application for offline use and user can access it anywhere, even while roaming.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
People love to travel places around. Whenever they get time, they visit the neighborhood, some heritage point, educational places, historical places, amusement parks etc.
The problem arises are, where to go? When to go? What is the specialty of that particular place? How to reach there? What all other facilities are available in the nearby area? Most of the times these questions remain answerless.
While planning for outing, deciding where to go is the first and the toughest part of the planning. Sometimes you get the answer and sometimes you don’t. Also there is a situation when you are deciding, thoughts occur, is it appropriate to visit that place, today?
And Their a problem arise  to where to go and how to go ,Sometime it is more difficult to know destination route for local people through Bus so finding Bus number  to go destination place .If you ask people but it is not sufficient that information  to want to go.
Sometimes that person forgot about that information told by another person .

There are lots of problem also arise :-
•	No internet connection 
•	Google map
•	Time consuming
•	Costly


The information you need to have is the historic value or USP of the place you are deciding to visit. Best commutation facility, how to reach there.

Generally, you don’t get all these information at a single place. You have to google about the place, read some blogs about the reviews and description of that place. Doing such things make it messy and consumes a lot of time to actually know the facts. People demand a solution to these multiple sources of information. They need a single platform to have all such information there, together and organized.
Also they need is that the information should be handy and not to be vague. The information should be easily portable form place to place. And carrying that information should not look awkward.
